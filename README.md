# Simple Zero Dependency Web Server

> A simple node.js web server build just with the built-in HTTP module. It only servers the files which are explicitly defined as routes in index.js

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Thoud/zero-dependency-web-server
cd zero-dependency-web-server
yarn or npm install
```

## Usage
